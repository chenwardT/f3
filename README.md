Tests

Ensure database user that interacts with the test database has superuser priveleges, as these
are required to (temporarily) disable referential integrity during the creation of fixtures.

`bundle exec rake test`

Implementation
==============

Infinite Forum Nesting
----------------------

Going with an adjacency list for forum hierarchy

* Easy to add leaf nodes
* Relocation is simple
* pgsql supports WITH RECURSIVE for efficient querying

Each Forum belongs to at most 1 Forum (forum_id).
If forum_id does not exist, then it is a “top-level forum”.
If forum_id does exist, then it is a “sub-forum” that falls under the Forum with forum_id.

The Forum#index (the root forum view) presents all top-level forums and their immediate sub-forums in a table, with 1 section per top-level forum and a row per immediate sub-forum.
Sub-forums that are 3-deep (i.e. distance of 2 from top-level) are listed as text within their parent forum’s description (same row in the table, but perhaps on a 2nd line).
Forums that are 4-deep or greater not listed -- subject to change! Good forum design dictates an upper limit on depth (3-deep?).

A Forum#show displays the forum in question’s subforums as a table, if any exist.
The "subsubforums" are then listed on a single line within each subforum’s row.
