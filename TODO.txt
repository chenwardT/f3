Consider naming conventions for Category/Forum models in userland.
e.g. In other popular forum apps, Categories are called "Forums" with Forums being called "Sub-Forums".

Consider allowing forums to be nested inside one another to any degree, instead of having Categories
at the top with at most 1 level deep Forum objects.
